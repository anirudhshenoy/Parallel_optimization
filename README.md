Particle Swarm Optimization for UAV Design
------------------------------------------
The idea behind the project is to create a program that is capable of designing a fixed-wing UAV from scratch, given certain constraints.

PSO_threading.py: Main file that contains methods for running PSO algorithm

naca_airfoil_gen.py: Generates airfoil coordinates using NACA 4-digit airfoil parameterization 

nonlinear_llt.py: Implementation of nonlinear LLT based on NACA TN 1269. 

PSO_threading_for_pi.py: Contains small changes to run the PSO code on a raspberry-pi
